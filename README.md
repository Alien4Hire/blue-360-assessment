# Blue 360¬∞ Assessment Solutions

This repository contains complete solutions to the two problems assigned in the Blue 360¬∞ technical assessment. Each problem is organized into its own folder for clarity and separation of concerns.

## üìÅ ProblemOne

### Task:
Transform and manipulate nested data according to specific instructions:

1. **Flatten nested arrays** into individual object entries.
2. **Sum arrays** inside the objects and store as `some_total`.
3. **Filter** to only include guests with a `guest_type` of `"guest"`.
4. **Sort** the array alphabetically by `last_name`, then `first_name`.

### How to Run:
No build setup is needed. Open `index.html` directly in your browser after running:

```bash
npm install
```

All code is written in `index.js`.

## üìÅ ProblemTwo

### Task:
A fully functional calculator app styled using Tailwind CSS and built in **React**. It replicates the behavior of a mobile phone calculator, including support for:

- Operator chaining and order of operations
- Percent and sign toggling (`+/-`)
- Floating point numbers (rounded to 9 decimals)
- Keyboard input handling

### How to Run:

1. Navigate into the calculator app directory:

```bash
cd blue-360-assessment/ProblemTwo/calculator-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
